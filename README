Here are some examples of the use of my Python binding
([GitLab](https://gitlab.com/ldo/python_pixman),
[BitBucket](https://bitbucket.org/ldo17/python_pixman)) for the Pixman pixel-manipulation library.
You will need to have both that and Qahirah ([GitLab](https://gitlab.com/ldo/qahirah),
[BitBucket](https://bitbucket.org/ldo17/qahirah)), my Python binding for Cairo graphics, installed
before you can run these.

Each example script generates its output to a PNG file with the same basename as the
script. Thus, to run a script *script* and see its output, you could do something like

> ./*script* && display *script*.png

Alternatively, you can see the generated output on my [DeviantArt
account](https://default-cube.deviantart.com/gallery/54316106/Python-Pixman-Examples).
