Here are some examples of the use of my
[Python binding](https://github.com/ldo/python_pixman) for the Pixman
pixel-manipulation library. You will need to have both that and
[Qahirah](https://github.com/ldo/qahirah), my Python binding for Cairo
graphics, installed before you can run these.

Each example script generates its output to a PNG file with the same
basename as the script. Thus, to run a script *script* and see its
output, you could do something like

> ./*script* && display *script*.png
